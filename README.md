# ðŸ§ª MATLAB Projects for Chemical Engineering

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB projects that model and simulate key systems in chemical engineering, with a focus on reaction engineering, process control, heat transfer, and machine learning for materials.

Each project is organized into its own folder and includes documented code, visualizations, and engineering context.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

## Completed

### ðŸ”¹ [CSTR + PFR Reactor Simulation](./matlab-reactor-sim/)
Simulates a first-order exothermic reaction (A â†’ B) in both a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) and a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR). Models both concentration and temperature dynamics, including a multi-curve analysis for varying coolant temperatures.

## To be completed

### ðŸ”¹ [PID Controller Design](./PID_Control/)
Implements a PID controller for maintaining reactor temperature in a dynamic CSTR system. Simulates controller tuning and response to disturbances.

### ðŸ”¹ [Carbon Capture Simulation](./CO2_Capture/)
Models COâ‚‚ absorption using amine solutions. Includes mass transfer, reaction kinetics, and energy balance in a packed column.

### ðŸ”¹ [Neural Network for Materials Prediction](./NN_Materials/)
Trains a neural network to predict material properties (e.g., conductivity, strength) from compositional or structural inputs. Applies basic preprocessing and model evaluation.

### ðŸ”¹ [Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer](./Pipe_Flow_HeatTransfer/)
Solves Navier-Stokes-based models for laminar and turbulent flow in pipes. Simulates temperature profiles and pressure drop under various conditions.
